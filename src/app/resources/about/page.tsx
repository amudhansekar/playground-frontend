        Playground is a website coded by a group of friends who enjoyed playing
        basketball together. We got tired, however, of people thinking that they
        were better than they truly were. They thought they were Jayson Tatum.
        They really were just Tobias Harris.

        In order to have solid proof to break through their delusions, we needed
        to keep track of stats. As a bonus, we could have some solid video proof
        as well. We started to code this website in order to realize our dream
        of being able to say, with solid prood, that they were mid basketball
        players.

          When you see someone carrying the ball all the time, use this website
          as video proof that they do it so they can stop denying it. That
          person probably also uses their elbows and shoulders a lot to create
          separation and gain an advantage.
